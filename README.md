Key Points:

1. Use of Functions:

   Three for the modes.
   
   One for the View Score to display the contents of the file.
   
   Use of Library Functions in Different Header Files (String.h, Time.h)
   
   and more...


2. Use of File 

   a. record.dat for storing username, mode, text, (date/time?) and wpm after completion of the typing session 
      display the same if the user selects View Score
