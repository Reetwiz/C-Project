### Key Points:

**1. Use of Functions:**

   * Three for the modes.
   
   * One for the View Score to display the contents of the file.
   
   * Use of Library Functions in Different Header Files (String.h, Time.h)
   
   * and more...


**2. Use of File** 

   * record.dat for storing username, mode, text, (date/time?) and wpm after completion of the typing session. 
   * display the contents of the same file if the user selects View Score.
